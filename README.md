# DCS removeJunk script 🕳

Sometimes players crash or bomb on airbases (or eject from the ground, making explose their airplane 🤬), creatings craters, wreckages or debris, all of them could be annoying for other players who didn't ask anything.
This script detects a crash in zones and delete the craters/wreckages/debris.

###How to install it?
- Open your mission in the mission editor
- Mist script is mandatory, load it first in your mission! https://github.com/mrSkortch/MissionScriptingTools
- Place zones (circle and/or rectangle) where you want remove proof of any accident 👀
- In the DCS_scriptRemoveJunk.lua file, add all the zone names in the zone_names list : local zone_names = {'zone1','zone2','zone3','zone4'} -- Put how much you want, can be separate airfields
- Load the script as you did to load the Mist script
- Host your mission and enjoy 😏

###What I ask in exchange?
- Mention a small credit to me in your server/mission 🥰
